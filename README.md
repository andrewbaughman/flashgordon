# flashgordon

speed. I am speed.

## Goals

The purpose of flashgordon is to gather useful data from the internet as quickly as possible.

A crawler will be ran to make get requests to URLs, parse the data from the response, and store relevant data.

As this goal is not a destination but rather a measure of improvement, the metrics used to measure progress will be Integrity and Performance.

### Integrity: By integrity, I mean completeness.
The data collected should be everything needed/useful, and the process used to collect it should be reliable, safe, and loving. 

Any changes made to the project should clearly improve its integrity.

### Performance: 
All processes within flashgordon should be fast and require as little work as possible to complete. 

Any changes made to flashgordon should measurably improve its performance.
